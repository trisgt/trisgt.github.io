        <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! My name is Tristan Pestoni Garcia. This is a blog I have made as an assignment for one of my university courses, using GitHub and Hugo. Before continuing, I&amp;rsquo;ll give you some time to appreciate how beautiful my website looks (let&amp;rsquo;s ignore that 99% of the work has been done for me).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I should talk about myself a bit. Some of the things I like the most are listening to music (which I do constantly), playing videogames, reading and writing. I also like technology in general, that&amp;rsquo;s why I have done this blog in the first place&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
